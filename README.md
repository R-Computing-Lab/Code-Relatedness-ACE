# Code-Relatedness-ACE
This repository contains all codes for the simulations in Lyu &amp; Garrison (2022) paper in Behavior Genetics. 
Note: We have already provided a integrated R package capable to replicate all simulations in this paper. The codes in this repo is just for review purpose. If you want to do your own simulated studies using the same simulation procedure, please check [ACEsimFit Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ACEsimFit/vignettes/ACEsimFit.html)

# Codes and data
All R codes and data are stored in <Simulation codes and data> folder. Difference variance combanitions are marked with the diffirent A variance. For example, <simulation analysis0.5.R> is the simulation analysis for variance structure of A = .5, C = 2.0, E = .5 in the paper. Since the simulations are time-consuming, the simulated data are saved as correspondant .RData files in the same folder.
# Figures
All figures in the paper are stored in the <Figures> folder.
