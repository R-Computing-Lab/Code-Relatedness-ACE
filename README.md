# Code-Relatedness-ACE
This repository contains all codes for the simulations in Lyu &amp; Garrison (2022) paper in Behavior Genetics. 

# Codes and data
All R codes and data are stored in <Simulation codes and data> folder. Difference variance combanitions are marked with the diffirent A variance. For example, <simulation analysis0.5.R> is the simulation analysis for variance structure of A = .5, C = 2.0, E = .5 in the paper. Since the simulations are time-consuming, the simulated data are saved as correspondant .RData files in the same folder.
# Figures
All figures in the paper are stored in the <Figures> folder.
